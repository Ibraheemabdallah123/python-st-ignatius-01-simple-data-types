# Simple Data Types in Python 📘

Welcome to the first module of our Python course at St. Ignatius College, focusing on Simple Data Types. This module is designed to lay a solid foundation for understanding how Python stores, manipulates, and utilizes data.

## 📝 Overview

In this module, we'll dive deep into the basics of Python programming, starting with objects and variables, moving through numbers and strings, and learning how to interact with users through keyboard input. Each section is crafted to enhance your understanding and skills in handling data in Python.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### Objects and Variables 🆔
Explore how Python uses objects and variables as references to store and manipulate data in memory.

### Numbers 🔢
Understand the numeric data types in Python, including operations on integers and floating-point numbers.

#### ➖ Integers
Learn about integer operations, their utility, and the integral part of Python's data types.

#### 🔄 Type Conversion with `int()`
Master converting other data types into integers for consistent data manipulation.

#### 🏗 Operator Precedence
Discover the rules Python follows in evaluating mathematical operators in expressions.

#### 🌊 Floating-Point Numbers
Dive into the world of floating-point numbers, their precision, and their importance in Python.

#### ➗ Type Conversion with `float()`
Get acquainted with converting various data types into floating-point numbers for numerical computations.

#### 🧮 Mathematical Functions
Explore Python's mathematical functions to perform complex numerical computations efficiently.

### Strings 📝
Strings represent textual data in Python. This section covers creation, manipulation, and practical uses of strings.

#### ✍ Creating Strings and Using `print()`
Begin with creating strings and displaying them, using the `print()` function for output.

#### 🎨 Formatting Styles: `format()`, f-strings
Learn about Python's string formatting options to produce neatly formatted textual output. Understand how to use the `format()` method for older Python versions and f-strings (formatted string literals) in Python 3.6 and newer for a more readable and concise way to format strings.

#### ↔ Type Conversion with `str()`
Understand converting other data types to strings, facilitating text processing and manipulation. This is crucial for combining numeric data with textual data in output or processing user input.

#### 📏 String Methods and Operations
Python strings come with a variety of methods that allow you to manipulate them effectively. Learn about methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.find()`, and more to process and analyze text data efficiently.

#### 🎭 Escape Characters
Dive into escape characters in Python, such as `\n` for a new line or `\t` for a tab, which allow you to include special characters in strings that would otherwise be difficult to type directly.

#### 🔗 String Concatenation and Repetition
Explore how to concatenate (join) strings together and how to repeat strings using the `+` and `*` operators, respectively. This is useful for creating dynamic output based on user input or program data.

#### 🧭 Accessing Characters and Slicing
Learn how to access individual characters in a string by their index and how to slice strings to obtain substrings. This is essential for text analysis and manipulation in Python.

#### 📊 String Formatting with Percent (%) Operator
Before f-strings and the `format()` method, Python used the percent (`%`) operator for string formatting. Though less commonly used today, understanding this method can be helpful for reading older Python code.


### Data Input from the Keyboard ⌨️
Learn to capture user input directly from the keyboard, allowing for interactive Python scripts and applications.
